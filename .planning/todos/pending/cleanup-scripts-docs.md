# Cleanup Scripts and Docs

**Created:** 2026-02-02
**Context:** Phase 3 planning discussion
**Trigger:** After stargazer becomes a reproducible Intune-joined VM

## What to Clean Up

After the milestone is complete (all phases done, working Intune-joined VM):

1. **Scripts consolidation** - Review scripts/, remove obsolete ones
2. **Docs consolidation** - Remove scattered docs that are now in hosts/stargazer/README.md
3. **Endurance cleanup** - Decide whether to keep/remove hosts/endurance/

## When to Do This

After Phase 7 (Documentation) or as part of milestone completion.
